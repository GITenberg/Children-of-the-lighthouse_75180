<small>THE ISLAND</small></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Will-ery</span> you-ery come-ery with-ery me-ery and-ery
play-ery?” shouted Ronald from the little patch
of green in front of the Lighthouse.</p>

<p>“Yes-ery, I-ery will-ery!” answered Lesley, jumping
up from the sand and tucking her book in a cleft
of the rocks. Scrambling up the cliff like a sturdy
little mountain goat, she reached Ronald laughing and
rosy and panting out breathlessly, “What-ery shall-ery
we-ery play-ery?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought,” said Ronald, descending from
their “secret language” to plain English. “Maybe
we’ll get Jenny Lind and bring up some kelp to put on
our gardens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call that play,” objected Lesley; “that’s
good hard work!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Oh, nothing isn’t work,” said Ronald, sensibly, if
ungrammatically, “if you do it for play.”</p>

<p>“You are the funniest boy, Ronnie, I ever knew in
all my life!” exclaimed Lesley.</p>

<p>“Sure I am!” laughed Ronald. “I must be, for I’m
the only boy you ever did know!”—and here they
both broke into a hearty peal of merriment that
brought their mother, smiling, to the window.</p>

<p>It was true enough. Lesley and Ronald, eleven and
eight years old, were the only children on the island
and the only ones who had ever been there, but they
were not by any means the only young things. There
was a score of light-footed, dancing kids, there was a
comfortable number of chickens, a rushing, scampering
horde of rabbits, “Jim,” the pet crow, and uncounted
half-grown sea-birds in the shelters of the
cliffs.</p>

<p>As for grown-ups, there were the children’s father
and mother, Malcolm and Margaret McLean, and the
old Mexican sailor, Pancho Lopez, commonly known
as “Stumpy.” Then there was the donkey, Jenny
Lind, so called for the power and melody of her voice,
and of course the parents of all the kids, chickens,
rabbits, and sea-birds. In the pools of the rocks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
on the beach there were jellyfish, great and small,
starfish, crabs and sea-anemones, but these, although
they added to the population of the island, could not
be said to increase its gayety.</p>

<p>Gayety, though, as everybody knows, never comes
from outside; it is just something that bubbles up
from within, and Lesley and Ronald McLean each
had a boiling spring of it in their own hearts.</p>

<p>The springs had not ceased to bubble after what
the children considered Ronald’s first-class joke, when
the sound of clattering hoofs and the roll of wheels
announced the approach of that Jenny Lind whom
they had intended to use as a playmate.</p>

<p>“Run, Ronnie, quick!” cried Lesley, “and see if
father’s going down to the beach. Maybe we can go
with him.”</p>

<p>“Hi! Father! Father!” called Ronald. “Wait for
us!” running at top speed toward the cliff.</p>

<p>The donkey was pulled in at once, turning her head
toward the children intelligently as they scrambled
down the rocks to the car and starting on her way the
moment she felt their weight and knew they were on
board.</p>

<p>The children’s island, one of those in San Francisco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Bay, is not a large one—perhaps three miles around—but
it looks as if it were three times three miles
deep in rocks. There are tall gray peaks shining like
spear-heads above the water—peaks where the sea-birds
build; great stretches of gray stone like castle
walls, with towers and battlements; scattered fragments
of granite heaped up like crumbs from a giants’
banquet, and ten trillion, two hundred and forty-one
billion, five hundred and ninety-seven million, six
hundred and nineteen thousand, four hundred and
three stones and pebbles of various sizes along the
shore.</p>

<p>Oh, no, there is no beach; just a rocky island with
rocky edges and old Ocean singing and sighing and
laughing and crying all around and about. No two-legged,
or four-legged, or ever-so-many-legged creature
could draw loads from the shore to the Lighthouse
over such a roadway, even if it had been on
level ground, and so Malcolm McLean, with the help
of old “Stumpy” and a man brought from the mainland
for a week, had laid down rails the entire distance
and prevailed upon the Government to send him a
little car which Jenny Lind pulled with ease over her
private track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Going down to the storehouse for oil,” called
Father, looking around at the youngsters from his
perch in front. “You can stay down there with
Stumpy for a while, if you like, or go back with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Stumpy, Stumpy!” cried Ronnie. “Maybe
he’ll tell us a story.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he will,” said Father, dryly, nodding his
head; “he’d rather tell stories than work any day.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Ronald, thoughtfully, “it might be
just the same as work if you had to make up the
stories.”</p>

<p>“But he <i>doesn’t</i> have to,” came quickly from
Lesley; “they all happened to him.”</p>

<p>“No, not all,” eagerly, from Ronald; “not ‘The
White Slipper’—I’m going to ask him for that
to-day.”</p>

<p>“No, not ‘The White Slipper,’” agreed Lesley.
“But I wish he’d tell us po’try, like what mother reads
sometimes. I made up some myself last night about
Jenny Lind.”</p>

<p>“About Jenny Lind? You couldn’t make po’try
about a donkey!”</p>

<p>“You just listen now and see if I couldn’t,” cried
Lesley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="first">“To shaggy Jenny Lind</div>
<div class="verse">There came an awful wind</div>
<div class="verse">And blew her over the cliff—</div>
</div></div>

<p>Over the cliff ... over the cliff—” slowly—“What
<i>was</i> the last line?”</p>

<p>“Which made her puff and piff,” laughed Ronald.</p>

<p>“No such word as ‘piff,’” objected Lesley.</p>

<p>“It’s just as good as ‘puff,’” answered the youthful
rhymester. “Isn’t it, Father?”</p>

<p>Father merely gave an absent-minded murmur,
which might have meant either that it was, or that it
wasn’t, and touched Jenny Lind lightly with the loop
of the reins.</p>

<p>Up flew Jenny’s hind legs, bounce went the children,
flat on the floor of the car, and all question of
po’try was dropped as they drew up to the storehouse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>STUMPY AND THE STOREHOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stumpy</span> stood in the doorway, waving a greeting to
the children, his wooden leg, topped by a crutch-handle,
strapped to his side and his black eyes glowing
with pleasure.</p>

<p>He limped down the steps to hitch the donkey for
the Lightkeeper, patting the children’s heads meantime,
as they tumbled about him like frolicsome
puppies.</p>

<p>“We’ve-ery come-ery to-ery see-ery you-ery!”
cried Lesley, who was accustomed to use the “secret
language” with Stumpy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see you come all right,” smiled Stumpy,
“but I no speak your tongue. You go in my house; I
be there pretty soon.... Aye, aye, sir, coming!”—this
to McLean, who waited for him by the barrels of
oil.</p>

<p>The children needed no further invitation to
Stumpy’s dwelling, for it was a museum of curiosities
in their eyes, and Ronald gravely wondered how it
could be safe to leave such priceless things within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
reach of the passers-by. True, there were no passers-by,
except those with wings or fins, or traveling on
four feet, but at any moment—why not?—a boat
might draw up on the strand and a pirate, with
a red sash and a knife in his teeth, leap to land and
snatch the treasures.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Stump-ery true,</div>
<div class="verse">I love you!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>crooned Lesley, as she sat down by a little table in the
corner.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Stump-ery’s a sailor,</div>
<div class="verse">Sure as I’m a tailor!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Ronnie, climbing on a chair from which height
he could see more easily the wonderful little ship on
the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“But you’re <i>not</i> a tailor, and you do make silly
po’try!”</p>

<p>“Neither isn’t Stumpy a sailor, <i>now</i>, and maybe
I’ll be a tailor, some time.... Oh, Lesley, isn’t this
ship the most be-you-tiful thing you’ve ever seen
since you lived in this country?”</p>

<p>Indeed it was a beautiful thing, the pride of
Stumpy’s heart and the light of his eyes. He had
bought it long ago in Mexico from the furnishings of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Spanish ship wrecked at sea and hauled into port by
a passing barque. Whoever originally owned it had
prized it dearly, for it stood under a glass case that
rested on an ebony stand bordered with scarlet velvet.
It was carved from creamy ivory—every mast, every
spar, every sail in place, a miniature steersman at the
helm and the Spanish ensign bravely floating at the
peak. It sailed upon a painted sea sprinkled with tiny
crystals of sand that sparkled like the blue waters
around the island, and it was undoubtedly one of the
most beautiful things that anybody had ever seen, no
matter in what country he or she had lived.</p>

<p>Ronald, though a daring and adventurous child,
continually watched by sister, mother, or father lest
he rush into danger, was yet careful in his own way,
and Stumpy knew that he might trust him with his
treasures and that the boy would admire “La Golondrina”
(The Swallow) without ever thinking of lifting
the glass cover that enshrined the tiny treasure.</p>

<p>While his silent worship was going on, Lesley was
lifting with careful fingers the feather pictures on the
table and admiring the birds, the flowers, the trees,
the little landscapes, all made of tiny feathers beautifully
colored and pasted into place. These were done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
by Indians, Stumpy had told her, and the black-eyed
squaws with their shawl-wrapped heads sold them on
market-days in the streets of the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>There were Indian water-jars in the room, too,
gayly decorated in colors, an Indian bow with its
arrows, gourds made into dippers and painted in scarlet
and black, and on the wall a tattered Mexican flag
with its warlike eagle grasping a rattlesnake and
standing on a cactus plant. “<i>Viva México!</i>” (Hurrah
for Mexico!) Stumpy used to cry as he saluted it in
the morning, and the children had learned to salute it,
too, the moment they crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>The room had been partitioned off from the storehouse
where the oil for the Light was kept and had
only a rough floor and whitewashed walls, but Stumpy
kept it beautifully clean, and on his small stove he
cooked wonderful red beans in Mexican style and
made chocolate for the children with foam on the cups
an inch high.</p>

<p>His was a lonely life on the edge of the restless
ocean, guarding the stores for the Lighthouse, and he
was as glad to have a visit from Ronald and Lesley as
they were glad to come. They were still admiring his
treasures when clatter, clatter, went Jenny Lind’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
hoofs again, and away rolled the car with its barrels of
oil for the Light.</p>

<p>Another moment, and “<i>Viva México!</i>” sounded in
the doorway and Stumpy appeared with an armful of
driftwood for the evening fire.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Stump-ery, bump-ery,</div>
<div class="verse">Give him a thump-ery!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>shouted Ronald, running to meet him.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to thump him, I’m going to hug
him,” cried Lesley and she did it, to the old sailor’s
great delight.</p>

<p>“Now a story, Stumpy, a story!” cried both children,
together, and Ronald added quickly, “The
‘White Slipper.’”</p>

<p>“‘White Slipper’? No, that too long. Your father
say come home one hour. Mother have dinner
ready.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” with dismal groans. “We thought
<i>you’d</i> ask us to dinner.”</p>

<p>“I would ask, sure I would, but your father boss,
you know. He my boss, your boss—Good sailor
mind his boss, you bet.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what <i>will</i> you tell us?” asked Ronald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
climbing on his knee. “I haven’t hardly heard a story
since I lived in this country.”</p>

<p>Stumpy looked at him with a twinkle in his eye.
“Since you lived in this country, hey? But that not
very long, you know. Well, I tell you a sea-story, one
I know, me, one I see myself—one about a cat.”</p>

<p>“A cat!” exclaimed Lesley. “I thought they
didn’t like water!”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Stumpy; “if they did, there would
be no story.”</p>

<div class="verse">Stump-ery, tell-ery!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>cried Ronald, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, it must be twenty year ago,” said Stumpy,
reflectively, “I ship on cargo steamer to Scotland,
your father’s and mother’s country, you hear them
tell.”</p>

<p>“‘Bonnie Scotland!’ we know,” said Lesley, drawing
nearer.</p>

<p>“We have good voyage Scotland, nothing much
happen, all same every day. We land cargo place
called Newhaven, all right, get new cargo take back—you
not care about that—and when everything
ready for leave, Captain say we go ashore, have good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
time. Some men they stay on board keep watch, but
ten go ashore, and messroom boy—he funny fellow,
I think he not right in head” (tapping his forehead)—“he
say he take ship’s cat, give her good time, too;
maybe catch Scotch mouse.</p>

<p>“We all laugh at him. I tell you he funny fellow,
and we go uptown and leave him on beach with cat.
Some men go get good dinner; some men get drunk,
like always; I find other sailor like me, been all over
world and we ‘swap yarn,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“We know,” nodding heads wisely, for old sailors
often came to the island.</p>

<p>“We have orders get back twelve o’clock night,”
continued Stumpy; “we know, anyway, got do that,
and we all start along ’bout eleven, pretty dark, big
wind, storm coming all right.</p>

<p>“We get to beach—some, they smoke, some
whistle, some walk pretty crooked, and Johnny,
that’s what mess-boy call himself, sing out to us,
‘Come on, boys, big storm ahead, cat get wet.’</p>

<p>“We all laugh some more and make fun, but we
don’t see anything till we get to boat and there be
Johnny with the cat—she was white one, thanks to
God!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Why do you thank God because she was white?”
asked Ronnie, curiously.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, little son, and you will know,”
answered Stumpy gravely. “We all get in boat, push
off, and begin to row hard as we can, but the farther
we get from land the blacker get the dark and the big
wave come splash, crash, lift us ’way up, sink us ’way
down, keep us tossing like ball in air. Every man do
his best; I pray to saints, but no can see ship’s lights,
no can see other men’s face, not know where we go.
Of a sudden, maybe pretty near ship—we can’t tell—come
wave like big mountain, knock every man
flat, turn boat over, upside down, no light, no help
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Stumpy,” sighed Lesley, patting his
sleeve, “how dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Every man start to swim best he know how, but
where he swim when he see nothing? We half-dead
already when we hear that Johnny sing out, ‘Look at
cat! Look at cat! See where she go!’ Thanks to
blessed saints, who let a little light down ’bout then,
we could just see white spot on top of wave and follow
it. Cat see in dark, you know, children, and she
not like water, want to get out soon as she can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“In one moment, we see lights, we see ship, we
shout and shout, and men come help us aboard, wet
like sponge, cold as ice, and frightened ’way to inside
of bones.”</p>

<p>“Were all the men saved?” quavered Lesley,
round-eyed with excitement.</p>

<p>“Alas, no! little daughter; two of them never seen
again!”</p>

<p>A sigh and a little silence followed, and then Lesley’s
voice was heard again, “And the cat?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the cat, thanks to God, that Johnny grab her
just as he get to ship’s side and carry her up ladder.
She ’most as good as Captain all way back to California,
best food, warmest place sleep, every man take
off cap to her when he meet, say, ‘Good-day to you,
Lady Cat!’”</p>

<p>“Good-day, Lady Cat!” mimicked Lesley, laughingly,
bowing to an imaginary pussy on the rug. “I
wish you a pleasant morning and a fat rat for your
dinner!”</p>

<p>“Dinner! Dinner!” cried Stumpy, jumping up
from his comfortable chair.</p>

<p>“What your father say, children? Run quick, like
rabbits! Go short way up steps! Run quick!”</p>

<small>THE LIGHT AND THE LIGHTHOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> reach the Lighthouse from Stumpy’s dwelling, you
might either follow Jenny Lind’s car-track a long way
around, or scramble up a rocky path, broken here and
there by a flight of whitewashed steps, till you arrived
at the top of the mighty heap of rocks that formed the
island. Should a high wind be blowing, you crushed
your hat far down on your head, gripped the handrail
hard when you reached the steps, and often sat down
flat until some sudden gust had passed by. As this
was Margaret McLean’s only fashionable promenade,
you can imagine that she seldom ventured on it, preferring
to stroll about the patch of green in front of
the Lighthouse, or to walk up and down between the
scanty rows of vegetables behind. She and her husband,
however, were well accustomed to seeing the
children scramble over the rocks like their own goats
and were never anxious about Ronald, if Lesley were
with him, for alone he was apt to venture too far and
attempt heights which he might reach, but never be
able to descend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>He had been only a tiny tot of two or three years,
running about the kitchen, when, sitting on the floor
in front of the sink one day, he had amused himself by
slipping the various cooking-pots over his head and
laughing out at Lesley with a “Peep bo!” from beneath
them. His mother, hearing the clatter, was
hurrying from another room to inquire into its cause
when a series of loud cries and calls for help were
heard. She found the baby completely extinguished
by a large kettle which Lesley was trying to pull off
his head, while the more he struggled and screamed,
the tighter grew the kettle.</p>

<p>Mrs. McLean pulled, Lesley pulled, Ronnie beat his
hands and kicked and roared until the mother was
thoroughly frightened. “Get your father, quick!” she
cried to Lesley, and the child climbed, panting, to the
tower where Malcolm was trimming the Light. She
was too breathless to speak when she reached him, but
he saw that something was wrong below and half-leaped,
half-tumbled down the stairs to the kitchen.
He took the baby in his arms and succeeded with his
big sailor voice in reaching the ears under the kettle.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Ronnie!” he ordered. “Stop crying at
once! Father’s here. Father’ll help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The screams stopped, the beating hands grew
quiet, and the Lightkeeper walked to and fro patting
the small shoulders till they grew still enough to allow
him to lay the child in his mother’s arms. Then, while
Lesley watched him with astonished eyes he seized a
lump of lard from the shelf, greased the inside of
the kettle and Ronnie’s head as far as his hand could
reach, saying all the time, “Quiet, sonny, quiet, sonny;
Father’s here!” This done, with one swift jerk the
kettle came off and the small boy was restored to the
world.</p>

<p>Oh, what a wonderful father, Lesley thought; there
was nothing that he couldn’t do and nothing that he
didn’t know, and I believe that everybody on the
island, including Jenny Lind, the rabbits, and the sea-birds,
thought much the same thing.</p>

<p>The wonderful father was waiting in the doorway
to-day as the children’s feet were heard on the rocky
pathway, and after a little washing of grimy paws and
smoothing of rough locks they all sat down at table.
Six times a year the Lighthouse tender called at the
island with stores for its inhabitants, so tea and sugar
and coffee, flour and meal, spices and cereals were
always on hand, but for the rest they depended on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
goats’ milk, fresh fish, eggs, chickens, rabbits, and
such vegetables as they could raise on their wind-swept
height, three hundred feet above the sea.</p>

<p>Margaret McLean boasted, when she could find
any one to hear her boast, that she could prepare
rabbit in fifteen different ways, but which one of the
fifteen she followed that day will probably never be
known. At all events, it seemed to please the children
who jumped down from the table when grace had
been said, quite refreshed and ready to dry the dishes
and help to set the room in order.</p>

<p>The apartment in question—a large one, fortunately—might
have been called one of general utility,
for it was kitchen, dining-room, sitting-room, and
study, according to the time of day. There was a
grand parlor on the other side of the passage, into
which the Lighthouse Inspector was ushered when he
made his semi-annual calls, but the children never
entered it except on cleaning-days when they were
allowed to dust the haircloth sofa, the straight-backed
chairs, and the round center-table with its big Bible
and tall lamp, hung with tinkling glass prisms.</p>

<p>The bedrooms and the playroom were on the next
story, and above that ran the flight of narrow steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that led to the tower, and then above them again the
corkscrew stairs that wound about and about till they
reached the Light.</p>

<p>In solitary splendor, like the Prince of Coolavin,
lived the Light, and Father waited upon it like a
slave, filling it with oil, trimming its wicks and polishing
and re-polishing and re-re-polishing the speckless
glass that sheltered it and through which its beams
streamed far, far across the waters.</p>

<p>Every night, as they sang the “Mariner’s Hymn”
together in the whitewashed sitting-room, with the
ceaseless roar and dash of the breakers as their accompaniment,
the children thought of the friendly
Light in the tower and the gladness of the sailors
when they saw it shine.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Eternal Father! strong to save,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose arm hath bound the restless wave;</div>
<div class="verse">Who bidst the mighty ocean deep</div>
<div class="verse">Its own appointed limits keep:</div>
<div class="verse">O hear us when we cry to Thee</div>
<div class="verse">For those in peril on the sea!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>So ran the words of the “Mariner’s Hymn,” and
Ronald, who always wanted to know the reason of
things, said thoughtfully one night when they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
finished singing: “Why do we cry to God to help those
in peril on the sea, Daddy? It’s the Light that helps
them, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Ronnie, you’re not thinking,” cried his
mother. “Who made the sea and the sailors? Who
gave his brains to the man who thought of the Light
and set it here? The Light is but a senseless thing and
needs some one to tend it, as well you know your
father does both night and day.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h!” murmured Ronald, “I see!”</p>

<p>“You’re a funny boy!” commented Lesley, as
usual.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="first">“Sleep-ery, head-ery,</div>
<div class="verse">Better go to bed-ery!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Oh-ery, no-ery,</div>
<div class="verse">Don’t want to go-ery,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>cried Ronald, at which his father lifted his head from
the “Lighthouse Journal,” saying, “‘Gude bairnies
cuddle doon at nicht’—you know the poetry your
mother tells you.”</p>

<p>The children were often allowed to climb the corkscrew
stairs with their parents to see the Light and
even to open the little door in the masonry and go out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
on the iron-railed gallery that ran around the tower,
holding tight to Father’s or Mother’s hand while they
gazed at the blue waters of the Pacific and counted
the white sails on the horizon.</p>

<p>The Light was not of the first order, although it
seemed so wonderful to the children and required
more attention than the newer and more expensive
ones. It was lighted at dusk, filled again at midnight,
and put out at dawn, Margaret McLean always taking
the last duty and then hurrying down to kindle
the kitchen fire, set the porridge on to heat, and milk
the goats.</p>

<p>She was a busy wife and mother; so busy that she
had the less time to be lonely, for not only did she
wash and iron, sew and knit, scrub and cook, milk the
goats, feed the hens, and weed the garden, but she
gave the children their daily lessons, making these so
pleasant that both could already read with ease and
had some knowledge of figures, while Lesley could
write a very respectable letter to Grandmother in
“Bonnie Scotland.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. McLean knew very well that the
children would never be likely to have any playmates,
save each other, while they were growing up, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
work on the island was not more than enough for one
man, with Stumpy’s assistance, and so there could be
no other families in residence. They had done everything
they could, therefore, to provide amusement
and occupation for them, indoors as well as out. Outdoors
was very simple, with Jenny Lind, “Jim Crow,”
and a host of young animals as playmates, the beloved
Stumpy as story-teller-in-chief and fishing, hunting
sea-birds’ eggs, playing on the shore and gathering
seaweed and shells as their games of never-ending
delight.</p>

<p>Indoors a playroom had been fitted up the previous
year, which was a continual source of pleasure and a
blessing, too, to Mrs. McLean, who could always feel
that her bairns were safe and happy when they were
in “Humpty Dumpty Land,” as Lesley had christened
it.</p>

<p>It was nothing more or less than the large attic
which ran the whole length of the Lighthouse. It was
not finished off, but the slanting sides and floor had
been stained a pretty green, and numerous shelves
had been fitted between the uprights for all the many
collections—birds’ eggs, seashells, sea-moss, shining
pebbles, bright beads, buttons, and those other treasures
dear to children, which would have been greatly
in the way downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>In one corner was a sand-bin, with little tins and
patty-pans for making cakes, and a dolls’ house occupied
another corner where Lesley passed many hours.
A rocking-horse, a stable, and a carpenters’ bench
were Ronald’s possessions, and several small chairs
and tables were among the other furnishings.</p>

<p>Tacked to the ceiling were a few gay Japanese
parasols and lanterns, while straw mats, a contribution
from Stumpy’s Indian collection, were scattered
about the floor. Turkey-red curtains were at the
windows, and altogether a more cheerful place could
hardly be imagined, especially when both children
were talking at once and “Jim Crow,” a privileged
visitor, adding an occasional low croak to the conversation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>HONEST JIM CROW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim Crow</span>, the black, the glossy, the dapper, the wise,
the solemn, was not a native of the Lighthouse island,
which indeed was too barren a spot for birds fond of
good things to eat. He was not a native, but an immigrant,
for the Lighthouse Inspector had brought him
to Lesley on one of his visits, saying that he had been
found in the woods on the mainland—just a little
bunch of fuzz with short dark feathers sticking out
here and there—and that it was supposed that he
had fallen out of the nest and been deserted by his
parents.</p>

<p>The Inspector had cared for him until he was now a
fine fellow with the glossiest of black feathers, and as
he appeared to be of a good disposition and of winning
ways there was no reason why he should not make an
admirable pet. The children thought so, of course,
and were never tired of watching his quaint actions
and laughing at his solemn manner.</p>

<p>As soon as Jim Crow grew wonted to his new home,
he began to choose his friends and seemed to love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Lesley most of all. Next to her he appeared to fancy
a large white hen, with a brood of nine little chicks, in
a coop under the shade of a rock. Jim used to visit
her many times a day, standing near the bars of her
prison and talking with her in a low, croaking tone.
Sometimes, between his stories, he would help himself
to the food left by Mother Hen and her family; then
begin croaking to her again, and Biddy would answer
with an occasional cluck as if she understood all that
he was telling her.</p>

<p>The old hen, while always watchful over her little
ones, never seemed to fear that Jim would hurt any of
them, and when the chicks became so large that they
were let out of the coop and the family roamed about
seeking for worms and insects, Jim still continued his
association with them, following them about for hours
each day. At nightfall, however, he always came back
to his box, while Biddy and her family joined the
other fowls in the hen-house.</p>

<p>Another of Jim’s chums was the tuneful Jenny
Lind. For some portion of each day he used to follow
her about, always keeping a few feet from her nose, as
she grazed.</p>

<p>When he grew tired of walking, he would hop to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
back, and, squatting upon her hips, where he could
not be reached by the switching tail, he would keep up
a constant croaking and chattering. This chattering
was always in a low tone, but it went up and down
just like the voice of a person who is telling some great
secret, something not to be repeated to any one else,
on any account.</p>

<p>Jim had his dislikes as well as his likes, and he evidently
held but a poor opinion of Margaret McLean.
She had often caught him snatching a morsel from the
kitchen table or shelves and had on each occasion
hastily swept him out with the broom. Nowadays he
entered the kitchen with a wary eye fixed upon her,
and if he did not go upstairs at once to Humpty
Dumpty Land, would perch in some high place and
scold and grumble to himself. You could always tell
from the tone of his voice whether he was scolding or
chattering, and Mrs. McLean said she really felt uncomfortable
sometimes, when that low croaking voice
went on and on behind her back, apparently saying,
“Meanie! Meanie! Mean old thing! Drove me
out! Drove me out! Wouldn’t give me any dinner!
Meanie! Meanie!”</p>

<p>Jim’s chief interest in Humpty Dumpty Land lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in the children’s collections and particularly in their
beads and buttons. Whenever he made a call upstairs,
after flying to Lesley’s shoulder and caressing
her with his beak, he betook himself to the green
shelves and turned over the beads, the buttons, and
the pebbles one by one, saying to himself, meanwhile:
“Oh! pretty, pretty! Pretty, shiny things! Jim Crow
like shiny things! Poor Jim Crow! Only have black
feathers! <i>Poor</i> Jim Crow!”</p>

<p>If these were not his exact words, though Lesley
contended that they were, they evidently embodied
his meaning and the gleam of envy and desire of possession
were so marked in his cunning black eye that
on the day of the children’s visit to Stumpy, Ronald
said as they played in Humpty Dumpty Land, “I
wonder if Jim Crow knows anything about your
necklace, Lesley!”</p>

<p>This precious treasure, a chain of tiny gold beads
sent from Grandmother in Scotland as a New Year’s
present, had totally disappeared a few weeks after the
holiday and not so much as a glint of it had ever since
been seen. Lesley had wept bitter tears over the loss
and had received many a scolding for her carelessness
with the pretty gift, but indeed, indeed, she told her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
mother, she had never worn it out of the house and
had always kept it at night in a box in her bedroom.</p>

<p>At Ronald’s query, Lesley gave a long look at her
pet, who was doing hard labor trying to break a
button in two, at the same time crooning to himself in
a low tone, “Crows have no pretty buttons! Crows
<i>ought</i> to have pretty buttons! <i>Poor</i> Jim Crow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Ronnie,” cried Lesley; “Jim would never
steal anything of mine; he loves me too well. Don’t
you, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Croak!” answered Master Crow, but he evidently
felt that the conversation was becoming too personal,
for he left the room at once in his most dignified manner.
He did not mention that he held a small red
button in his beak, but, as he said afterwards,
“What’s a button between friends?”</p>

<p>“I’m going right down to Father and see what he
thinks,” cried Ronnie, running after Jim Crow.</p>

<p>“No, no, Ronnie! Don’t tell Father! I’m sure Jim
never took my necklace!” called Lesley, in distress.</p>

<p>Ronald was already halfway downstairs and heard
not a word his sister said in his haste to find Father,
who was discovered at length in the doorway of Jenny
Lind’s stable smoking his afternoon pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“What’s the trouble, sonny?” he asked. “Haste
makes waste, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Father, I’ve just thought. Do you believe
Jim might have taken Lesley’s necklace?”</p>

<p>“Jim?” questioned his father in a puzzled way.
“Oh, you mean Jim Crow? Why, I don’t know.
What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” cried Lesley, appearing at this
moment; “Ronnie hasn’t a bit of reason to say Jim
took it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the boy, a little daunted by his sister’s
indignation, “I only thought.... You know yourself
how much he likes shiny things, and Mother <i>has</i>
caught him stealing in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>A burst of tears was Lesley’s answer and her father
shook his head at Ronald, saying in a kind voice:
“Don’t cry about it, daughter. I mind now that there
was an old raven in Scotland stole my grandfather’s
spectacles once, but maybe he wasn’t well brought
up.... I tell you what, children,” bringing his hand
down with a thump on his knee, “Jim Crow <i>has</i> got a
‘hidy-hole’ up there on the cornice of the house. I’ve
often watched him go there. I’ll get the long ladder
and see what he keeps in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Oh, let me, Daddy,” cried Ronald. “I’ll climb up
the water-pipe.”</p>

<p>“You will not, then,” said his father, decidedly;
“it’s bad for the pipe and bad for your clothes, and
you’re too heedless and reckless altogether with your
climbing.”</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. McLean had joined the group
and heard the tale, and she now laid a restraining
hand on the boy’s shoulder, while Lesley’s tears were
dried in the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>The long ladder was brought, laid against the house,
Father climbed slowly up, reached the spot in the
cornice where he had so often seen Jim Crow, and
crying out, “Well, if this doesn’t beat the Dutch!”
burst into a hearty fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, what, Father? Oh, what?” cried the children,
dancing with impatience.</p>

<p>“Let them come up the ladder, Mother,” called
Malcolm. “I’ll hold them and they can see for themselves.”</p>

<p>The children were up before you could say Jack
Robinson, and, looking into a sheltered place on the
cornice, just behind the water-pipe, beheld Jim Crow’s
hidy-hole with an astonishment not to be described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>It was a veritable robbers’ cave, for it held a number
of bright feathers, some tinfoil, a variety of beads
and buttons, one of mother’s thimbles, several pieces
of colored glass and china, and, and—yes, it really
<i>did</i> hold Lesley’s necklace.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father! Oh, Father!” cried Lesley, half-laughing
and half-crying. “Don’t take everything
away from poor Jim; do leave him something!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, you silly child!” called her mother
from the foot of the ladder; but her father said, dryly,
“I suppose you don’t think it necessary to leave him
the thimble and the necklace, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” whimpered Lesley. “I know that
would be silly, but he <i>will</i> be disappointed to find
them gone when he comes to look at his collection.”</p>

<p>“I’m ’fraid he will, poor old Jim,” sighed Ronnie,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, come down the ladder!” called Mother, impatiently.
“I’m tired of holding it. If you don’t want
to hurt Jim Crow’s feelings, make him another chain,
but bring down my thimble, anyway.”</p>

<p>Mother’s suggestion was received with enthusiasm.
The party descended to earth, but the ladder was left
in place while stout thread and large needles were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
demanded. Lesley and Ronald sought their stores in
Humpty Dumpty Land, and in the course of an hour
put together a necklace which would have shamed all
the jewels of the Princess Badroulboudour in the
“Arabian Nights.”</p>

<p>Malcolm McLean, laughing at the pranks of his
astonishing children, climbed the ladder and placed
the ornament in Jim Crow’s hidy-hole and when next
that honest bird went to examine his treasures, he is
reported to have exclaimed, “My stars and garters!
What do you think of that? Now that’s what I call a
necklace!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was but a short time after the adventure with that
highway and byway robber, Master Crow, when it
came time for Stumpy’s annual vacation, and he
puffed gloriously away in the Lighthouse tender for
his week in San Francisco. As his place was taken
meantime by a dull seafaring gentleman having two
legs, but no acquaintance with the art of story-telling,
the children greatly missed their old friend and were
wild with joy when, the day after his return, he
begged their father to let them come down to the
shore for a picnic.</p>

<p>It was Saturday; of course there were no lessons, of
course there were fresh doughnuts, fresh bread, and
goats’ milk cheese, so was not a picnic the simplest
thing in the world? There was every probability, too,
that Stumpy might make chowder in a kettle on the
rocks and, oh, why did children have to be scrubbed
and brushed within an inch of their lives when the
sun shone and the waves called to the picnic?</p>

<p>Preparations at last being completed they set off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Ronnie carrying the basket and scampering like a
rabbit down the rocky path.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for Lesley, I’d never trust him so long
out of my sight,” sighed Mrs. McLean, watching
them from the doorway.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Stumpy, you know,” said her husband,
drawing near, “and Ronald climbs like a cat.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he does do,” agreed Margaret.
“I never knew a cat but could climb up a tree, but
there’s a many that don’t know how to get down.”</p>

<p>Malcolm laughed in his good-humored way. “It’s a
fine thing you’ve got your children on an island,” he
said. “If they were on the mainland, you’d be worrying
about them night as well as day.”</p>

<p>Lesley meantime was composing a piece of po’try in
the secret language, which was to be a sort of ode to
Stumpy on his return from foreign parts.</p>

KIND OF PO’TRY IN ITSELF</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These were the four opening lines and there were to
be another four to be recited by Ronald, in which
Stumpy was to be asked to recount the incidents of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>his visit. These were never composed, however, for
just as the last line of the first verse was thought out,
a turn in the path disclosed Stumpy and the chowder-kettle,
and as they drew near an odor arose that was
the best kind of po’try in itself. A large school of
porpoises, far out at sea, had just smelled it distinctly
and asked for a holiday to find out what it was, and
Ronald exclaimed, as his nose wrinkled and wrinkled
and sniffed and sniffed, “That’s the best smell I ever
smelled since I lived in this country!”</p>

<p>“You bet good smell!” laughed the old sailor.
“Everything good in that chowder, but how you
children get along all last week without Stumpy,
hey?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Stump-ery true-ery,</div>
<div class="verse">We love you-ery!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>cried Lesley, hugging him hard.</p>

<p>“Oh-ery, how-ery we-ery you-ery miss-ery!”
shouted Ronald, in a burst of eloquence.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Stumpy, “I ask boss for time off some
day and learn your language. Pretty hard learn, I
guess. Maybe you better learn Spanish; then we all
three have secret. Come now, you get plate and
spoon, little son; we have dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>If it wasn’t time for dinner by the clock, it was by
the stomach, and no geese fattened for killing could
have been rounder and shinier than the picnickers
were when the meal was over. A walk to the cave
where their father had once saved nine lives from a
wreck had been promised the children, but rest on a
smooth rock seemed better after such a feast, and
after much coaxing Stumpy consented to tell a story,
meantime.</p>

<p>It is better, perhaps, to tell it as Stumpy would
have done could he have used his native tongue,
for his English was faulty, and though it was clear
enough to Lesley and Ronald it might not be so to
the reader.</p>

<p>“It was two years ago, my children,” Stumpy began,
his eyes looking far out to sea, “when I visited a
cousin in Santa Barbara and went many times during
my stay to service at the old Mission and talked with
and learned to know the good Fathers there. Naturally
I told them where I lived and that my work was
on an island, and Father Francisco promised to tell
me a strange island story some evening when he was
not busy. The time came and this is the tale in his
own words, as far as I can remember them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of Juana Maria</span></h3>

<p>“There are eight islands in the Pacific, off the coast
of Santa Barbara, lying from thirty to seventy miles
away and protecting the mainland from fierce winds
and heavy tides. The nearest of these are now used
for sheep-grazing, and San Nicolás, the farthest off,
was formerly noted for its fine herds of otter and seal.
On this San Nicolás lived a tribe of Indians—if they
<i>were</i> Indians, for no one seems really to know—and
at the time of our story, nearly one hundred years ago
now, it was heard that the tribe had been reduced by
disease to less than twenty souls. A fisherman whose
boat had been blown far out to sea by adverse winds
had landed on the island for fresh water and brought
the news back to Santa Barbara, adding that one old
man among the natives had been able to speak Spanish
and had begged him to tell the Missions along the
coast of their plight and to implore the good Fathers
to rescue them from their island prison.</p>

<p>“The news spread throughout southern California
and all were eager to send for the islanders, but no
ship large enough for the purpose made its appearance.
At last, the <i>Next-to-Nothing</i>, a schooner that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
had been on a hunting expedition in Lower California
appeared in San Diego Harbor with a cargo of otter
skins for sale and the skipper made a bargain with the
Franciscan Fathers to sail to San Nicolás and bring
the exiles back.</p>

<p>“The trip was made, but even before the <i>Next-to-Nothing</i>
reached its destination a gale sprang up and
a landing was effected with great difficulty. No time
was wasted ashore and the islanders who, of course,
had had no warning as to when, if ever, they would be
sent for, were hurried into the boats in great excitement
and confusion and all speed was made to reach
the schooner.</p>

<p>“Somehow, in the hurry and hurly-burly a child
was left behind whom a young mother had placed in
the arms of a sailor to carry aboard. How this may
have been we do not know, but no such child was to
be found, and the mother, desperate with fright, with
pleading gestures implored the Captain to return.</p>

<p>“To do this would have been almost impossible and
would have imperiled the lives of the whole party, and
the skipper could only shake his head at the woman’s
frantic pleading.</p>

<p>“Finding that they were putting out to sea the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
girl, for she was little more, leaped overboard and
struck out through the angry waters for the shore.
No attempt was made to rescue her, perhaps none
would have been possible, and in a moment she was
lost to sight in the huge waves that crashed against
the rocky coast.</p>

<p>“The <i>Next-to-Nothing</i>, after a stormy voyage, at last
reached the harbor of San Pedro and the islanders
were distributed among the neighboring Missions.
The skipper planned to return at once to San Nicolás
to look for the mother and child, but first going north
to San Francisco for orders from the owners, the
<i>Next-to-Nothing</i> was wrecked at the entrance to the
Golden Gate and, there being no other craft at the
time fit for the hazardous journey, the expedition was
given up. The Franciscan Fathers never lost their
interest in it, however, and for fifteen years they
offered a reward of two hundred dollars to whoever
would go to San Nicolás and bring them word of the
unfortunate mother and her child.</p>

<p>“In the fifteenth year of the offer, a seal-hunter
did visit the island, but could find no trace of human
occupation, and people began to forget the story.</p>

<p>“Three years later a Santa Barbara man organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
an otter-hunting expedition to San Nicolás and took
with him a large company of Indian guides and
trappers. He had heard the tale of the abandoned
pair, but saw and heard nothing to make him think
they were still living, or on the island.</p>

<p>“On the night before they were to leave San
Nicolás, however, Captain N., walking on the beach,
saw before him the print of a slender foot—”</p>

<p>“Oh! like Robinson Crusoe!” interrupted Lesley.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Ronnie, “and Man Friday!”</p>

<p>“He saw the print of a slender foot,” continued
Stumpy, “and knew it was that of a woman. He
organized a search party, but found nothing that day
save a basket of rushes hanging in a tree with bone
needles, threads of sinew, and a partly finished robe of
birds’ feathers made of small squares neatly matched
and sewed together.</p>

<p>“Inland, they discovered several roofless enclosures
of woven brush and near them poles with dried meat
hanging from them, but no human beings. These
were sure signs, however, that the island had inhabitants
and Captain N. kept up the search with a will.
After two days fresh footprints were found in the moss
that covered one of the cliffs and, following them up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
a woman was discovered, crouching in terror under a
clump of low bushes at the top. Captain N. greeted
her gently in Spanish, and in a moment she came
timidly towards him, speaking rapidly in an unknown
tongue. Nobody in the party understood a word she
said, although there were Indians of a dozen tribes
among their number. Captain N. described her as a
tall and handsome woman, in middle life, with long
braids of shining black hair and a curious and beautiful
dress of birds’ feathers, sleeveless and with
rounded neck.”</p>

<p>“Could she have been the child left on the island?”
interrupted Lesley, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Stumpy. “She was too old for
that. The child must have died, and this must have
been the girl who leaped from the boat.</p>

<p>“She seemed gentle and quite willing to be taken
back to the Santa Barbara Mission, where, although
there were then many Indians there and the Fathers
themselves spoke many tongues, no one of them
understood her language.</p>

<p>“The good Fathers baptized her under the name of
Juana Maria, and she made no protest, whatever they
did, or pointed her out to do. She drooped, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
so the story goes, from the moment she left the island,
seemed dazed and looked about with questioning
eyes, and one day she fell from her chair in a faint and
the next morning had passed quietly away. Father
Francisco showed me her grave in the shadow of the
Mission tower, poor lost creature, alone and lonely in
a strange world!”</p>

<p>“And no one ever really knew who she was, or what
had happened to her?” asked Ronald.</p>

<p>“No; how could they when they could not speak
her language and she had no time to learn theirs?
She might not even have been the woman they were
looking for; she might not have been an Indian at all;
who knows?”</p>

<p>“Poor, poor thing!” mourned Lesley. “Oh, what a
sad story, Stump-ery, bump-ery!”</p>

<p>“So sad,” cried the old sailor, lifting himself from
his rock, “that I forget my work. You wait here, you
children; I come back one half-hour and we go where
your father save me from wreck and where I lose my
leg and that was one day, half good luck, half bad
luck,” looking down ruefully at his crutch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>HOW THE CAT CLIMBED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Stumpy had gone, Ronald wandered off among
the rocks looking for sea-birds’ eggs for his collection,
and Lesley strolled along the shore picking up shining
shells and telling herself a story. In this romantic
tale she was a princess prisoned in a tower on a
far-off island, but the suitors who landed there, having
heard of her marvelous beauty, were unable to
declare their passion as, unfortunately, she understood
no tongue but her own and that was strange
to all of them.</p>

<p>As it fell out, the long-lost prince, her brother, in
command of a gallant ship, chanced to pass by the
island and, arriving at exactly the right moment, was
beginning to give language-lessons to the handsomest
of the suitors, when—</p>

<p>“Hi, Lesley, hi! Where’s Ronnie?” called a hoarse
voice that broke in upon her dreams.</p>

<p>“Ronnie? He’s right here—”</p>

<p>“Where, then? I no see,” objected Stumpy, limping
down among the pebbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“He <i>was</i> here a moment ago— Oh,” in immediate
fright, “where <i>can</i> that boy be?”</p>

<p>“You no watch him?” asked Stumpy, with lifted
eyebrows. “I think you always watch Ronnie.”</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Lesley, in a grieved voice, “I
<i>always</i> do, but I forgot one moment. Oh,” breaking
into sobs, “<i>where</i> is he and what will mother say?”</p>

<p>“I know very well what she say,” observed
Stumpy, dryly, “but what we do before she say?”</p>

<p>“He must be climbing the rocks, somewhere, he
<i>must</i> be, for he said only this morning that he hadn’t
found a murre’s egg since he lived in this country.”</p>

<p>Stumpy could not but smile at this Ronald-like
speech, though at heart he was a little anxious.
“H——m,” he murmured. “Well, if it was a murre’s
egg he want, he have to climb pretty high— Halloo,
halloo, Ronald!” he shouted—“Where are you?
Halloo! Halloo!”</p>

<p>“Halloo! Halloo, Ronnie!” called Lesley in her
high, clear voice.</p>

<p>No answer, but an unusual fluttering and screaming
of sea-birds around the “Gateway Rock” showed
that something was amiss there and the old sailor and
the girl started off in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Now the Gateway Rock was the central one of
three sisters stretching out from shore, the third being
entirely surrounded by water and the second one
partly on and to be reached by land. Near the top of
its jagged, shining masses was a narrow opening like a
door through which you saw the heaving blue waters
of the Pacific like a picture in a frame of ebony. The
three rocks were particularly favored by gulls, murres,
and cormorants as their resting-place and Ronald had
climbed there before under his father’s advice and
direction. Now, however, he had mounted the
heights alone, for Lesley could plainly see his small
figure in the Gateway as they drew near and a bit of
something white that must be a handkerchief, fluttering
in his hand.</p>

<p>When they had painfully reached the base of the
Gateway Rock, it was plain that Ronald was calling
them and that he was not hurt. The roar of the
breakers against the cliffs was so loud that they could
not hear a word he said, but his gestures showed that
he had got himself into a trap and saw no way to get
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">LESLEY COULD PLAINLY SEE HIS SMALL FIGURE
IN THE GATEWAY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I can help him down if I can only get up there,”
cried Lesley, starting to climb the slippery cliff, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Stumpy held her back. “No,” he shouted, “one
enough; I get him down.”</p>

<p>“But how can you, Stumpy,” Lesley faltered,
“with your wooden leg?”</p>

<p>“Got wooden leg, yes,” answered Stumpy, cheerfully,
“but got two arms all right. No be sailor for
nothing. You wait; you see!”—and waving his hand
to Ronnie he started off for the storehouse.</p>

<p>Lesley waited on the black rocks in an agony of
fear expecting every moment that Ronald would slip
down from his perch, and while she watched his small
figure and turned with almost every breath to see if
Stumpy hove in sight, she kept saying to herself, “No,
I didn’t watch him; I didn’t. I forgot all about him.
Mother will never call me her faithful little girl
again!”</p>

<p>There was, in fact, no danger for Ronald if he kept
quiet and did not try to climb down the steep cliff
alone, but the anxious sister did not realize this, and
it seemed to her that hours had passed when she spied
Stumpy limping down among the rocks with a large
bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>“All right, Ronnie!” he shouted, as he drew near,
“I come pretty soon, now.” And he unrolled a coil of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
rope before Lesley’s astonished eyes and took from
within it his Indian bow and a bundle of arrows.</p>

<p>He held up the bow and the rope to the boy, who
could see, though he could not hear, and who waved
his hands and clapped them to show that he understood.
Not so did Lesley, however, who looked on
with a white face as if she thought that Stumpy intended
to tie Ronald up with the rope and then shoot
him with the arrows.</p>

<p>“See, little daughter,” explained Stumpy, kindly;
“I tie little string to arrow, tie big rope with loop on
end to string, then shoot arrow up to Ronnie. He pull
up rope and slip loop round big rock. Then I climb up
rope, so”—illustrating hand-over-hand movement—“and
I be up there pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“But how can you get Ronnie down? He couldn’t
climb down a rope.”</p>

<p>“No, that all right. He know. I do that one day up
by Lighthouse. You remember? I let your father
down by rope to get little lamb that fall over cliff and
catch on rock. You remember?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” eagerly. “Stumpy’s coming, Stumpy’s
coming!” she cried, turning to the boy.</p>

<p>The proper arrow was finally selected, the cord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
fastened to it, the great bow bent, and whiz! went the
shaft to its mark, the side of the Gateway. In a moment
Ronald had snatched it, pulled up the rope with
all the strength of eight-year-old arms, found the loop
and slipped it over a convenient peak. He tried it
to see that it was taut—(“Smart boy, that!” murmured
Stumpy)—and waved his hand to show that
it was all right.</p>

<p>Stumpy limped to where the end of the rope hung
dangling, threw off his cap and woolen jacket, wet his
hands in a pool of the rocks and started to climb, as
he had once done on shipboard. It was not far—one
hundred feet, perhaps—but far enough for a one-legged
man and far enough for a small boy shivering
in the windy Gateway above, who knew well enough
that he should not have been where he was and that
he was causing untold trouble by his carelessness.</p>

<p>There were sharp points and projections here and
there in the great rock against which Stumpy could
rest his good foot and get a little breath, but he
reached the top almost at the end of his strength and
unable to return Ronald’s bear-like hug of welcome.</p>

<p>“You get down, young man, ’bout as soon as you
can,” he panted. “This be ’bout the last time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Stumpy get you out o’ trouble. He getting too old.”</p>

<p>So saying he pulled up the end of the rope, motioned
the boy to come nearer, fastened it cleverly about his
body with loops over the shoulders, told him to sit
down in the threshold of the Gateway, with legs hanging
over the cliff, and with a “Ready, now! All
right!” lowered him slowly downward into Lesley’s
arms. The old sailor braced himself, meantime,
against the needle of rock where the rope was fastened,
but even so and with Ronald’s light weight it
was all he could do to manage the job, and the boy
noted with distress how long it took his beloved friend
and playmate to recover his breath and gather
strength to climb down the rope himself.</p>

<p>Ronald was ready to meet him when he reached the
safety of the rocks below and to hold out his hand and
say, like a man, “I’m sorry, Stumpy, and I’ll never be
so careless again. Thank you, and Mother and Father
will thank you, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no need thank,” smiled Stumpy. “Everybody
help friend in trouble. But now other trouble
begin. Got to go home and tell boss what you do and
Lesley tell she forgot to watch like Mother say.”</p>

<p>Both children hung their heads and blushed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
they knew their duty well enough and had known it
without Stumpy’s reminder, so they set off for the
Lighthouse, hand in hand, with a sorrowful good-bye
for Stumpy.</p>

<p>The soft-hearted old man watched them go with a
half-smile and a half-sigh. “Good children!” he said.
“Good boy, that Ronnie, but too much like little cat.
Climb up so far she can go; never think how she get
down!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. and Mrs. McLean heard the children’s story
quietly and laid the blame on Ronald, where it rightfully
belonged.</p>

<p>“You <i>must</i> learn to be more careful, son,” warned
his father. “It’s no good for me to punish you. You
must find out how to punish yourself so that it will
make you remember.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give up the murre’s egg!” cried Ronald, who
had carried it safe home in the breast of his jacket, in
spite of his adventures.</p>

<p>“That would be a foolish thing,” objected his
mother. “You did no wrong in trying to get the egg,
only in not asking Stumpy if it was safe for you to go
up the Gateway Rock alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“I won’t go down to Stumpy’s for a month, then,”
sniffed the culprit.</p>

<p>“That would be punishing Lesley as well as yourself,”
said his father, severely. “Think again!”</p>

<p>“But I <i>deserve</i> to be punished,” interrupted Lesley.
“I didn’t watch Ronnie, like Mother always says, and
I’m older than he is and ought to remember.”</p>

<p>The boy’s face flushed at his sister’s generous
words. “Then I’ll let Lesley take Jenny Lind to
water for a whole week,” he cried, “though you
always said”—this with a catch in the breath—“that
it was a man’s place.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said his father, affectionately, “and now
you talk like a man.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll give up my pudding for a week, and
maybe I’d better go to bed now and then I shan’t hear
you read the next chapter of ‘Robinson Crusoe’
to-night.” And here the small sufferer really began to
sniff, and made his way blindly to the staircase, still
with the murre’s egg tightly clasped in his grimy
paw.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father, oh, Mother!” sobbed Lesley. “He
won’t have to go to bed, will he, poor Ronnie?”</p>

<p>“‘Poor Ronnie’ will have to learn to look before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
leaps,” said his father, quietly. “Going to bed never
hurt anybody, yet.” And though Margaret McLean’s
own eyes were moist she nodded her head in
silent agreement.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Green-y blue, blue-y green,</div>
<div class="verse">Best-est fire that ever was seen!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>chanted Ronald in the Lighthouse sitting-room one
foggy evening in the late summer.</p>

<p>It was indeed one of the “best-est,” if not the <i>very</i>
bestest fire that ever was seen, for it was built of driftwood
from some old copper-bottomed wreck and the
flickering flames were pale blue-y green like a robin’s
egg, deep green-y blue like a peacock’s breast, yellow
as star-shine and sunset clouds, while underneath
glowed a deep red, with now and then a purple bloom
upon it.</p>

<p>“I picked up the wood on the shore this morning,”
said Mr. McLean, looking at the fire with satisfaction,
“and brought it up with the oil on the car with Jenny
Lind. It must have come from the wreck of the old
<i>Hamburg</i>.”</p>

<p>“When was she wrecked, Father?” asked Ronald.</p>

<p>“Oh, long ago, before our time. It was on a night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
just like this, probably,” looking with a shiver at the
blank, white-covered windows. “The Captain of the
<i>Hamburg</i> was steering straight for us, they say, hoping
to catch sight of the Light through the mist, but
his aim was too good and he sent his ship right into
the hundred-foot channel between the islands and a
sunken rock did the rest. The men were all saved, I
believe, but the good ship lies there still, or most of it,
only the water is so deep that you can’t even see the
topmasts.</p>

<p>“God help the poor folk at sea, to-night!” sighed
Mrs. McLean, “and we so cozy here!”</p>

<p>It was the usual evening party at the Lighthouse,
Margaret McLean knitting, her husband smoking and
reading his book, and Lesley and Ronald playing
checkers at the table. Nothing could have been more
secure or peaceful, for Jim Crow was there, perched
on a chair-back in the corner, half-asleep, and it was
known that Jenny Lind was safely reposing in her
stable, after a delightful day spent in doing next to
nothing.</p>

<p>The fog had been lying about in thin trails across
the sky for many hours, but had waited till night to
mass its forces together into a thick blanket, white as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
a roll of cotton and as dense. The Light, so Father
said, could hardly be seen a hundred yards from the
tower, so the steam fog-signal had been started and
was sending out its long shrieks of melancholy warning,
“Dan—ger! Dan—ger-r-r! Keep awa-a-a-y!
Keep a-w-a-a-a-a-y!”</p>

<p>It was well that the little family had its own resources
on such a night, for though the Lighthouse
tender brought letters and papers only once in two
months, there were a number of well-selected books
on hand and these could always be read and re-read.
There was a Government cable, of course, to the
mainland, but it was not supposed to be used save for
danger, death, disaster, doctors, and drugs, and the
longing for a daily paper could not be classed under
any of these heads.</p>

<p>“A-a-a-a-h! A-a-a-a-h!” groaned the fog-signal
and Mrs. McLean looked up from her work. “Did
you happen to notice, Father,” she asked, “in the
last ‘San Francisco Chronicle’ we had, that story
about the eight-year-old boy out in Wyoming that an
eagle tried to carry off?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I spoke of it at the time. What
makes you think of it now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Why, because Stumpy read it, too, and he was
saying when he was up here to-day that it was a ‘foolishness,’
as he called it, and no bird could carry such a
weight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not so,” said Mr. McLean, decidedly,
while the children dropped their checkers and pricked
up their ears for a story. “I don’t know about a good-sized
boy, but we know that an eagle could carry a
small one. My idea is that they can lift as much in
proportion to their weight as a hawk or a horned owl,
and I’ve known a horned owl to snatch up a large
house-cat and make off with it.</p>

<p>“My belief is that if hawks or owls can carry more
than twice their weight—and everybody knows they
can—that an eagle could do as much, or more, perhaps.
Once, when I was a lad, I found an eagle lying
helpless on his back in the road shot through the body
with a rifle-ball, poor creature. I was kind of afraid
of him, he looked so fierce, and I up-ended a long road
skid and dropped it on him. Before it reached him he
stretched up and caught it in his claws and held it up
the length of his legs above him. I walked up on the
skid and stood over him, and he easily held me and
the skid, which I should judge would weigh more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
twenty pounds. I took pains to be weighed myself
that same day and tipped the scales at one hundred
and nineteen pounds. You tell Stumpy that, and tell
him to put a stick in the claw of a wounded eagle and
let him grasp a small tree with the other and a man
must be stronger than ever I was to take the stick
away from him.”</p>

<p>Ronald had left the table as soon as eagles, hawks,
and horned owls had begun to fly through the conversation
and now leaned on the arm of his father’s
chair.</p>

<p>“I should think, Daddy,” he said in his wheedling
way, “that it would be a good night to tell us that
story about the baby that was carried off to Garrison
Mountain when you were a little boy in Maine. I
haven’t heard it, I do think, more’n once since I lived
in this country.”</p>

<p>McLean laughed. “I’m no story-teller,” he said,
“and a good thing I’m not. What with Stumpy and
his tales and your mother there and her ballads, you
children would never have learned to read if I’d told
stories, too.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about my ballads,” advised
Mother, good-humoredly. “You like them just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
well as the children do. Tell the boy about the white-headed
eagle. I’d like to hear it again, myself.”</p>

<p>“It was a good while ago it happened,” said
McLean, “for it was not long after my father and
mother died and I was brought over from the old
country to an uncle on a farm in Maine.</p>

<p>“We knew that two old white-headed eagles built
their nest every year on a crag of Garrison Mountain
in plain sight of the folks in the valley and we heard
them screaming over us every spring when they came
back to settle down again in the old homestead. The
charcoal-burners in the camps used to hear them, too,
as they swooped down to the lowlands for rushes and
grass to line their nest, and when the great eggs were
laid and the mother was keeping them warm, many a
lamb or little pig did the old father eagle take her for
her dinner. Mothers used to be extra watchful of
their babies for the first few weeks of spring, but nothing
ever did happen and of course they thought nothing
ever would.”</p>

<p>“Would an eagle really like a baby better than a
lamb?” asked Lesley, fearfully.</p>

<p>“Why, no, of course not, child. It would only see
something soft and light that might be good to eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
and snatch it up. Well, one warm spring morning
when the apple-trees were in bloom Mrs. Shadwell
had set her baby boy out to play on the grass in the
care of his sister, and had left him but a few moments
when a shadow flew by the window; she heard the
flapping of great wings, cries and calls of distress, and
she rushed to the door just in time to see old Father
Whitehead rise into the air with the baby in his claws.
There was nothing to do but to scream and scream
and to snatch the big dinner-horn and blow blast after
blast upon it to summon her husband and the
charcoal-burners.</p>

<p>“The neighbors gathered in a few moments and
plainly saw the giant bird with the white bundle in
his grasp circling toward his nest. It was dreadful to
see the agony of the parents and to hear the mother
cry, ‘Oh, they’ll tear my Willie to pieces. Oh, save
him, save him!’</p>

<p>“But how were they to save him? Many a time had
the best marksmen of the settlement tried to shoot the
robber pair, but never had succeeded, and it would be
a terrible risk now to try and hit the old bird while he
carried the child in his grasp. Fortunately an old
hunter—‘Dave,’ they called him; I never knew his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
other name—had lately come to the settlement from
the North woods where he had been trapping sable.
Luckily, he heard the horn-blast on the hills and knew
it meant danger of some kind.</p>

<p>“Reaching the valley, he saw the great bird overhead
with his white burden, saw the crowd of neighbors,
and judged what had happened.</p>

<p>“He loaded his long rifle, ran toward the bridge
where he could get a better view of the eagles’ nest,
leveled his piece on the rail and knelt on the planking.
The father followed him begging him to be careful, to
be careful, or he would kill the child, but old Dave
waved his hand for silence, watched the eagle as
he soared upward and the mother bird circling and
screaming over the nest—and waited!</p>

<p>“I was only a boy, but I shall never forget the
fright and the suspense in the eyes of the neighbors
while they waited for Dave’s shot. It was a long range
and the bullets fired by the best marksmen in the
village had always failed to reach it, hitherto.</p>

<p>“Would the old hunter have better success? Could
he kill the bird and not the child?</p>

<p>“At length the eagle slowly descended to the nest
where his young ones were clamoring for their dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and, just as he reached the rocky platform on which it
was built, Dave fired.</p>

<p>“We held our breaths, but before the smoke from
his rifle had disappeared the head of the mighty bird
was seen to fall. Dave waved his hand again for silence
and leveled his piece a second time, for the
mother was slowly circling down to see what was
amiss in the nest. The old man was a wonderful
marksman, the best I shall ever see, for he fired again
just at the very moment when she was stretching out
her feet to alight and in a second we saw her tumble
down the side of the crag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was splendid!” cried Ronald, his eyes
sparkling with excitement, “and then the poor mother
knew that her baby was safe.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered McLean. “She knew nothing
of the kind, and none of us did. How did she
know but the young eagles were big enough to tear
the child to pieces? How did she know he would not
toss about and roll over the cliff?</p>

<p>“No, the thing was to get him out of the nest, and
to do that they had to climb a crag that nobody had
ever gone up, not the best man in the settlement.
And they wouldn’t have done it then, if it hadn’t been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
for old Dave. I was one that helped the men carry the
ladders and the ropes to the foot of the crag. I saw
them climb as far as they could get a foothold and
then set a ladder up into a gnarled oak that grew out
of the rocks above. Dave climbed to the oak, pulled
up the ladder and set it still farther up, lashing it to
the oak-tree, while Shadwell—the baby’s father, you
know—clambered after him on another ladder the
men had brought. He followed Dave till they found
a part of the cliff where they could climb without
ladders, and then, holding on by tough shrubs that
grew here and there, they dragged themselves up to
the top of the crag.</p>

<p>“But then, you see, they were too high up and old
Dave had to rope the father and lower him down to
the nest which was built on a kind of rocky platform
below.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor mother!” sighed Mrs. McLean, “not
knowing all that time whether the child was alive or
dead!”</p>

<p>“They very soon knew,” said her husband, “for
when the father found the child alive and unhurt, he
held it up for us all to see, and then, what a shout
went up from the valley!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“But how did they get the baby down?” questioned
Ronald.</p>

<p>“Much the same way as Stumpy got you down
from the rock the other day; they roped him and lowered
him into the arms of the men who were waiting
at the foot of the first ladder and there were plenty of
arms and good, strong ones too.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was a wonderful sight. I never shall forget
it, though I haven’t thought of it for years, and
shouldn’t have now, if your mother hadn’t read that
story in the ‘Chronicle.’”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” Lesley asked her mother wistfully,
“if the little sister had been watching the
baby, that maybe the eagle wouldn’t have carried
it off?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t say,” answered her mother, briskly;
“an eagle is a good-sized bird to fight, but I <i>can</i> say
that it’s past time for you two to be in bed!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lesley did not fall asleep as quickly as usual that
night, and when at last she drowsed she awoke with a
sudden start and a beating heart. What had frightened
her? She did not know, but she tiptoed to the
window to see if the fog had lifted and found that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
was clear and the Light shining bravely across the
waters. The door between her brother’s room and her
own was always left open at night, for she had had a
care of him ever since he was a baby and she glanced
through it as she went back to bed. She stopped in
amaze, for there was no dark head on the pillow there.
Where was Ronnie? She was in the room in a minute,
and looking in the closet, under the bed, in the corners,
then back in her own room where perhaps the boy
might be hiding and trying to frighten her. No, no
Ronnie there.</p>

<p>She ran to her mother’s door with a cry, and Mrs.
McLean, hearing, lifted her head to say, “What is it,
Lesley? Are you sick?”</p>

<p>“No, Mother, but I can’t find Ronnie,” with a
little gasp of fear.</p>

<p>“Not find Ronnie!”—and in a moment Mrs. McLean
had hurried on slippers and an old shawl and
was in her boy’s room. In another moment Malcolm
was there, too, gathering some clothing about him as
he came, and together they looked in every likely and
unlikely place upstairs. Then Malcolm hurried to the
floor below, calling back that every door was shut and
bolted on the inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“The cellar!” cried Mrs. McLean, but no, that
door was also closed and bolted.</p>

<p>“He must be in the tower, then,” exclaimed Father,
hurrying to the second floor again, and Lesley
and her mother followed him as he ran up the corkscrew
stairs to the Light.</p>

<p>All was peaceful there; the lamp blazed like a splendid
sun and the speckless glass protected it from all
wandering breezes. All was peaceful, but the little
door in the masonry was open and the three dived
through it into the gallery that ran around the tower.</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Mrs. McLean, “don’t speak to
him! He’s walking in his sleep.”</p>

<p>That is just what the boy was doing, in fact—walking
on the gallery in his little white nightgown,
his eyes fast closed, as calmly as if he had been at play
on the grass.</p>

<p>“Get behind him, quietly, Malcolm,” whispered
Mrs. McLean again, “so that he won’t fall, but don’t
speak to him now. Let him alone and perhaps he’ll
come in, himself.”</p>

<p>They watched silently as Ronald came toward
them, went back again and then, with arms outstretched,
seemed trying to climb the tower, still with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
fast-closed eyes. Half-clothed and shivering in the
night air, they watched him make this attempt three
times and then pass them by, totally unconscious of
their presence, slip in through the little door, and
make his way downstairs to bed.</p>

<p>The boy did not waken even when his mother
wrapped the blankets more closely about him, but
slept on sweetly while the watchers hung above his
bed.</p>

<p>“Has he ever walked in his sleep before, Lesley?”
asked Malcolm, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, Father, no; I never saw such a thing. He
always talks in his sleep a lot, you know, but he
doesn’t get up.”</p>

<p>“It’s likely he won’t remember anything about this
in the morning, Lesley, and we’ll tell him when he
comes downstairs,” said Mother. “I’ll fasten his door
now and then we’ll get some sleep. Thank Heaven,
we found him in time!”</p>

<p>In the morning when his astonishing feat had been
related to Ronald, he only half-believed it until the
evidence of three pairs of eyes was brought forward.</p>

<p>“What were you trying to do, Ronnie?” asked
Lesley, curiously—“trying to climb up the tower?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Oh, I remember!” cried the boy, “I remember
now. It was a dream I had and I was climbing up a
rock to reach an eagle’s nest.”</p>

<p>“Then, in future,” said his father, good-humoredly,
“as you seem determined to climb by night as well as
by day, you will please tie a string to your toe when
you go to bed and hitch the other end of it to Lesley’s
bedpost. Then, at least, you’ll have a companion
when you start on your midnight rambles.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE WHITE SLIPPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long after Ronald’s sleep-walking adventure
when the faithful Stumpy was stricken with a
sharp rheumatic attack that made it necessary for
him to come up to the Lighthouse and be nursed by
Mrs. McLean. On the whole he found his illness
rather agreeable than otherwise, for Ronald and Lesley
were his constant companions and the Lightkeeper
laughingly said more than once that he didn’t know
when he hired Stumpy whether he had engaged a
nurse for his children, or an assistant for his own
work.</p>

<p>When the old fellow was recovering and could limp
about almost as well as usual, he rambled out one
balmy day with his young friends and they all sat
together on the rocks in the sun. Not a feather of
breeze was blowing, a thing most remarkable and to
be remembered, for King Æolus was supposed to have
his cave in the immediate vicinity of the island and to
let out from it all his romping, roaring winds every
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Jenny Lind, though not invited, had joined the
party and was looking down upon them, benevolently,
from a high rock; several sheep were scrambling about
near by and a rabbit occasionally appeared, stood on
his hind legs, sniffed the air, and disappeared again.
Jim Crow was there, perched on the donkey’s back
and croaking certain remarks in a low tone about this
being a hard world, anyway, and it was a strange thing,
so it was, that a poor crow couldn’t have a red ribbon
around his neck, like Lesley. From time to time he
eyed the steel chain that hung from Stumpy’s pocket
with such a covetous air that its owner clapped his
hand over it in pretended alarm and cried laughingly,
“Oh, you Jim Crow! You young, handsome bird!
You no want take chain from poor old man.”</p>

<p>“Jim-ery Crow-ery, never-y you-ery mind-ery!”
cried Lesley, affectionately. “Bad-ery Stump-ery,
tease-ery you-ery!”</p>

<p>“Oh-ery you-ery think-ery Jim-ery never-y bad-ery!”
exclaimed Ronald.</p>

<p>“Oh, that secret language! When I learn?” sighed
Stumpy. “I tell you many times you better learn
Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re willing,” answered Lesley, cheerfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
“We always were. Teach us some now. We know
‘<i>Viva México!</i>’ to begin with.”</p>

<p>“I think you not even know my name in Spanish,”
said the old man, seriously. “My name Francisco
Lopez, or Pancho Lopez, if you want use little name.
In Mexico children like you call me Don Pancho.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right,” said Ronald. “I’ll call you
that, and now we know four words.”</p>

<p>“If we learn eight more words this afternoon and
that will make twelve, will you tell ‘The White
Slipper?’” asked Lesley, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure I will,” agreed Don Pancho, and the children
set to work at once and learned the Spanish for
<i>donkey</i>, <i>crow</i>, <i>sheep</i>, <i>lamb</i>, <i>rabbit</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>boy</i> and <i>girl</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s done,” said Ronnie with a sigh of
content, “and now ‘The White Slipper.’”</p>

<p>Here is the story, but it would best be told as the
little Pancho heard it at his mother’s knee and not in
the halting English he had learned since then.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The White Slipper</span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p>“There was once a king of great riches and a great
kingdom whose queen was no longer living and who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>would have been very lonely on his golden throne had
it not been for his beautiful daughter, Diamantina.</p>

<p>“Only fifteen years old was Diamantina, but how
beautiful and how graceful! When she rode through
the streets of the city, her eyes and her jewels shone
like the sun at midday and she had more lovers than
there are grasses in the meadow. For all that, her
father, King Balancin, had no idea of marriage for her
and indeed she was too busy with her birds and her
flowers to think about a husband.”</p>

<p>“But where is the White Slipper?” the children interrupted.</p>

<p>“Well, that is exactly what Balancin wanted to
know,” said Stumpy, “and I will tell you all about
it this very minute.</p>

<p>“Everybody in this world, my dears, no matter
how happy he seems to be, has yet some trouble to
bear, be it small or great, and Balancin’s trouble was
of very good size.</p>

<p>“The monarch was devoted to the sport of hunting
and one day, while pursuing the wild boar, he fell
from his horse into a ravine where his face and hands
were torn with thorns and his foot received a grievous
wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“All the doctors in the kingdom were summoned to
him, one after the other, but no one of them cured the
wound which kept the poor king in constant pain. At
length a learned physician from another country was
heard of, was offered a magnificent fee and summoned
to the palace, and after examining the injured foot he
declared that he could not cure it, but that he could
make a sandal or slipper for it that would quiet the
pain. This offer Balancin eagerly accepted, and the
physician gave orders for the slipper, which was to be
made of kid-skin, beautifully soft and white and was
guaranteed to last one thousand years from that date.</p>

<p>“When this wonderful object was delivered, the
monarch naturally wished to try it at once, but the
physician warned him that it must first be soaked for
eight days in a liquid which he, only, could manufacture,
if it were to be of any service.</p>

<p>“This was done, the famous White Slipper was finally
put on and, oh, joy! Balancin was comfortable
once more. His delight was such that he made the
physician the most extravagant offers to remain at his
court, but the learned man replied that he had many
patients awaiting him in his own country, and he departed,
at length, laden with the richest of presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“The king was now as happy as the sun on Easter
Day and so was the charming Diamantina who had
shared to the full in her father’s distress, but, alas!
children of my heart, the joys of this world are
fleeting!</p>

<p>“The date of the king’s birthday now drew near
and great preparations were made for the occasion.
There was to be a water festival, an afternoon of
sports and games, a grand banquet at night, fireworks
and an illumination of the palace. The king and his
beautiful daughter appeared early upon the streets,
arrayed in the greatest magnificence and were cheered
and applauded wherever they went. The day was
spent in gayety, but, at night, as Balancin stepped
into the boat which was to take him back to the
palace his foot caught on one of the thwarts and,
shaking it, in a moment of impatience with the pain,
off fell the White Slipper into the stream!</p>

<p>“The king cried out in distress, but, as it was
already dusk, no one noticed his loss, and he fell
swooning into the bottom of the boat before any one
understood what had happened.</p>

<p>“The courtiers rushed to his rescue, but in their
haste they overturned the boat in so doing and upset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the unfortunate monarch into the water. Diamantina
fainted, at once, on seeing her father’s plight, and
parent and child were carried insensible to the palace
where an end was immediately made to all festivities.</p>

<p>“Balancin remained insensible for three days and
therefore could not order a search for the White
Slipper; Diamantina, however, recovered on the
morning after the accident, inquired for the treasure
which none of the careless attendants had even
thought of up to that time, and, finding that it was
missing, immediately fainted away again. When she
came to herself she at once organized search-parties
both by land and by water in every direction, but
neither then nor at any other time was so much as an
inch of the White Slipper ever found.</p>

<p>“The king, again pursued by pain both night and
day, fell into the deepest gloom, the princess wept like
a fountain, and the court was plunged into mourning.
Messengers were dispatched for the foreign physician,
but, alas! in spite of all his learning he had departed
this life.</p>

<p>“The unfortunate monarch now posted notices in
every part of his kingdom offering the hand of Diamantina
and the succession to the throne to whosoever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
would find the White Slipper. The princess, ready to
sacrifice all for her beloved father, watched from the
palace windows the swarm of youths who swam and
dived in the neighboring stream in search of the missing
treasure. The town looked like a seaside resort in
the bathing season and, wherever you went, showers
of drops were scattered over your garments as the
dripping figures, with chattering teeth, darted in and
out of the waters.</p>

<p>“At last, when Balancin was completely discouraged
and ready to put an end to his life, he heard a
disturbance one day in an antechamber of the palace
and sending to inquire the cause found out that a
fellow of the streets, a mere nobody from nowhere, as
the servants expressed it, had had the impudence to
call at the palace and ask to measure His Majesty’s
foot for another shoe like the one he had lost.</p>

<p>“‘And what did you do with the fellow?’ asked
Balancin.</p>

<p>“‘We packed him off at once,’ cried the servants,
‘and gave him a good drubbing besides for his insolence.’</p>

<p>“‘Very ill done,’ frowned the king. ‘The meanest of
my subjects has a right to attempt, at least, to do me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
a service. Send for the youth. I can hear what he has
to say, if I can do no more.’</p>

<p>“The poor fellow was sent for at once, and, appearing
before the monarch and giving him a respectful
salutation, begged permission to measure the injured
foot and to place upon the wound a small plaster that
would ease the pain until he could complete the cure.</p>

<p>“Balancin was astonished at the ease and assurance
of the youth, but he liked his face and his manner and
allowed him to make the examination, which he did
with the greatest care. The plaster was scarcely laid
on the wound when the king felt some relief and, more
astonished still at this result, he asked his caller’s
name.</p>

<p>“‘I am very well known in the city, Your Majesty,’
the youth answered humbly, ‘although I have no kinsfolk
and never knew my parents. When I was little
they called me “Goldfinch,” because I always sang in
spite of my troubles and they call me “Goldfinch”
still.’</p>

<p>“‘And you think you can cure me, Master Finch?’
asked Balancin.</p>

<p>“‘I am sure of it, sire.’</p>

<p>“‘And how long will it take?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“‘I can hardly manage it in less than fifteen days,
sire,’ answered Goldfinch.</p>

<p>“‘And what do you require for the cure?’ inquired
the king.</p>

<p>“‘A good horse, strong and swift, Your Majesty.’</p>

<p>“Balancin was astonished again, and the courtiers
could hardly restrain their laughter, but the monarch
replied at once: ‘The horse shall be yours, Master
Goldfinch, and in fifteen days I shall expect you here
again. If you succeed in the cure, you know what the
reward will be; if you fail, your daring will receive a
fitting punishment.’</p>

<p>“Goldfinch made a profound bow and withdrew;
the horse was provided at once, and the youth left
the city followed by the hoots and jeers of the entire
populace.</p>

<p>“Now I must tell you, my children, who Goldfinch
was and how he became possessed of so much medical
knowledge.</p>

<p>“His parents having died in his infancy he was
taken in, out of charity, by an old apothecary who
had nothing left of his business but his learning and
his library.</p>

<p>“As the boy grew, he applied himself to study the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
books with which the walls were lined and was greatly
assisted and encouraged by his benefactor, who, upon
his death, bequeathed to his charge all the weighty volumes.
The youth gained a light employment to support
his scanty needs and spent his remaining time
in study, whereby, one day, he found a marvelous
specific for wounds which, however, required the use
of a plant only to be found at a great distance and
was thus completely out of his reach, as he possessed
neither horse nor money.</p>

<p>“He had often seen the Princess Diamantina in her
royal progress through the city and cherished for her a
passionate affection, but had had no hope, even of
speaking to her, until he saw the king’s proclamation
published in the streets and so was emboldened to
call at the palace and offer a substitute for the White
Slipper.</p>

<p>“Astride his good horse, Goldfinch now galloped
away for six whole days, stopping hardly to eat and
only to snatch an hour’s sleep at night, and finally, in
the depths of a thick wood, he found the plant so
much desired. He plucked it, placed it carefully in his
bosom, and <i>Katakées, katakás, katakées, katakás</i>, he
was off again, galloping back to the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Reasoning that if the king were willing to give his
daughter and his kingdom to the man who should
furnish him with a shoe to ease his pain, he would be
even more grateful to one who should cure him altogether,
the youth prepared his balsam according to
directions and mixed within it the juices of the
precious plant.</p>

<p>“This done and before the fifteen days had quite
expired, Goldfinch presented himself at the palace and
asked for an audience with the king. All was immediately
prepared for his reception and the court assembled,
the beautiful Diamantina entering by her
father’s side. She saw at once that the new physician
was young and of good appearance and, modestly
casting down her eyes, awaited her fate.</p>

<p>“Goldfinch approached His Majesty and after the
usual salutations inquired of him whether he would
prefer another White Slipper, or a complete cure of the
wounded foot. Balancin naturally replied that a complete
cure was what most he longed for in the world,
whereupon Goldfinch at once applied his precious
balsam to the wound. A few moments slipped by,
and the king, the courtiers, and most of all the princess,
waited with bated breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Suddenly Balancin started to his feet, he walked,
he ran across the floor, and finally, in a transport of
ecstasy, he danced gayly about the room, tossing his
crown before him like a ball into the air.</p>

<p>“‘Approach, my benefactor, approach, Prince
Goldfinch!’ he cried, ‘and I will gladly give thee thy
reward.’</p>

<p>“Drawing toward him his beloved daughter, who
was blushing like a white cloud in the setting sun,
Balancin joined the hands of the young couple and
ordered the immediate celebration of their wedding.</p>

<p>“Prince Goldfinch, attended by respectful courtiers,
withdrew to a sumptuous apartment in the
palace and shortly issued clad in white velvet embroidered
in gold. Diamantina, in garments frosted
with lace and glittering with gems, joined him at the
altar and amid the cheers of the populace the marriage
took place.</p>

<p>“The new-made prince filled equally well his double
offices of husband and son-in-law, and on the death of
Balancin reigned over the kingdom many years in
peace and contentment.”</p>

Caw! I know a better story than that, about a pirate

<p>There had been a rabbit in almost constant attendance
upon the party, but he had popped up and
popped down so frequently that it was hard to tell at
any given time whether it was himself or his brother,
and probably timidity would have hindered either of
them from giving applause even to a better story than
that of the White Slipper.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>LESLEY TO THE RESCUE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> seemingly uneventful weeks slipped by after
Stumpy’s recovery and return to the storehouse, but
you may be sure that they were far from uneventful to
the folk of the island. Life is never very dull when,
like the gulls, the murres, the gannets, and the rabbits,
you have to seek out your daily food and shelter
and go without it, if you find nothing suitable. The
domestic animals on the island were well provided
for; still, there were daily and exciting climbing-parties
among the goats and kids, and Jenny Lind
amused herself by hiding away from the Lightkeeper
whenever there seemed a chance that she might be
asked to draw the little car to the shore.</p>

<p>The children had books and lessons, fishing and
gathering sea-moss and shells for their occupations,
and on days of blinding fog, or unusually fierce wind,
they always sought Humpty Dumpty Land, where
they played with dolls, arranged their collections,
used their tools, cut out and pasted pictures, or
dressed up Jim Crow with beads and ribbons, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
tying a long silken trail to his inky feathers and
seeing him walk about the attic, mincing along like an
elderly lady on a slippery ballroom floor.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ho! ho! ho!</div>
<div class="verse">Old Jim Crow,</div>
<div class="verse">You’re the funniest kind of a bird,</div>
<div class="verse">I ever did know!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Ronald one morning when they had dressed
their pet to particular advantage.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie!” cried Lesley, “that’s not a good
verse.”</p>

<p>“Why not, then? It sounds good to me.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s too long in the middle. It ought to be,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ho! ho! ho!</div>
<div class="verse">Old Jim Crow,</div>
<div class="verse">You’re just a funny bird;</div>
<div class="verse">And that I know!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Well, maybe that <i>is</i> better,” agreed Ronald, “and
I can dance it, any way.” And he began to whirl
about the playroom, stamping out the measure with
a will.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, Ronnie!” cried Lesley; “you’ll tear the
house down.... I wonder,” she added slowly, holding
the crow to her cheek while he caressed her with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
beak, “if Father will let us take old Jim if we go
away.”</p>

<p>“Why, shan’t we take <i>everything</i>?” questioned
Ronald, with wondering eyes. “Jenny Lind and Jim
Crow and the goats and—no, not the rabbits, o’
course.”</p>

<p>“And—not Jenny Lind, nor the goats either,”
said Lesley, shaking her head. “They belong to the
Gov’ment, you know, like Father says the Light
does.”</p>

<p>“And does Stumpy belong to the Gov’ment?” in
awe-stricken tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Lesley, cautiously, “but
I believe he <i>must</i> belong to us, so prob’ly we could
take him.”</p>

<p>This question, not of the removal of Jim Crow and
Stumpy, but of the entire family, had been one that
had prevented Mr. and Mrs. McLean for some time
from finding life dull or unexciting. The Lighthouse
tender had come in since Stumpy’s illness began and
had brought a letter from the “Gov’ment,” a big one
with a big seal, to Malcolm McLean.</p>

<p>It looked on the outside just like an ordinary letter,
with a check in it for salary, perhaps, or a notice of oil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
that had been shipped for the Light, but in fact it held
a bomb that exploded when the envelope was opened
and filled the whole house with surprise and excitement.</p>

<p>The “Gov’ment” said, and said it very handsomely,
that Malcolm McLean’s work as Lightkeeper
on Friar’s Island had long been known and appreciated
and that, considering his fine record and his
length of service, it had been decided to appoint him
to the care of the Santa Barbara Light, which was on
the mainland, had a good house with plenty of ground
for cultivation, was within easy reach of the town,
with its churches and schools, and commanded a
better salary.</p>

<p>It seemed and it was a wonderful appointment, but
it was entirely unexpected and required a great deal of
consideration. Ronald declared that he had never
heard such a letter since he lived in this country,
and his father asked him, with a twinkle in his eye,
whether it was the praise of the Lightkeeper, or the
thought of leaving the island that so astonished him.</p>

<p>“’Course I <i>knew</i> you were the best Lightkeeper,
ever,” explained Ronald, carefully; “I knew that
when I was a little boy, but I ’spected we’d live on
this island forever’n ever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“And I thought so, too,” Lesley chimed in eagerly.</p>

<p>“No wonder they thought so, Malcolm,” smiled
Mrs. McLean, turning to her husband, “when they
were both born here and have hardly ever been away.
I don’t know but that I thought so, myself, and it
will be hard to leave the old place, if we decide to
go. Still,” hesitatingly, “there’s the church and the
schools for the children.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said McLean, “we’ve talked it over till
we’ve nearly worn it out, but that letter to the Lighthouse
Commissioner has got to be written to-night
one way or the other”—and here he brought his
hand down on the table with a bang—“for it’s got to
be sent by the tender to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is the <i>Vigilant</i> coming to-morrow? Oh,
goody, goody!” cried Lesley, jumping up and down
and clapping her hands.</p>

<p>“Let’s-ery go-ery to-ery bed-ery earl-ery!” whispered
Ronnie, drawing Lesley into a corner.</p>

<p>“What-ery for-ery?” inquired Lesley, with a look
of astonishment.</p>

<p>“To-ery see-ery tug-ery come-ery in-ery first-ery,
you-ery goose-ery!” laughed the boy.</p>

<p>The mother laughed, too, seeing the whispering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
pair, and inquired, “Who do you think will understand
your ‘secret language,’ if you go to Santa
Barbara?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll teach it to the natives, like the Missionaries
did when they first came to California,”
cried Lesley, gayly, jumping out from her corner.</p>

<p>Of course as the Lighthouse tender was sent only
once in two months and as no other vessel touched the
island regularly, to see her come in was a great event
and one always viewed with excitement by the entire
population, with the exception, perhaps, of the sea-birds,
the rabbits, and the fishes, who did not care
much for outside gayety.</p>

<p>The Lightkeeper, with Jenny Lind and the car, was
early on the shore, long before the <i>Vigilant</i> could have
been hoped for, and Stumpy, waiting in the storehouse
door, saluted the Boss in nautical fashion and
limped to his side to exchange opinions on wind
and weather. Mrs. McLean forsook her usual stroll
among the cabbages and, tying herself up in a shawl
against the wind, her head as tightly bandaged as a
sausage, she took her stand at the top of the flight of
steps nearest the Lighthouse where everything could
be seen and heard. The children stood by her side, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
first, but soon clattered down the steps and along the
rocky path to the shore, where novelty and gayety
seemed more possible.</p>

<p>It was a gray day with a troubled sea and the air
was filled with the screams of the sea-birds and the
dash of the breakers against the black and jagged
rocks. As to that, however, these noises were as familiar
to the island-folk and as little noticed by them,
as the rumble of street-cars and the honk of automobiles
are to people of the city.</p>

<p>The children had hardly reached the shore, where
Stumpy and the Lightkeeper were already stationed
in their little rowboat, when a trail of white smoke was
seen on the horizon, and jumping up and down in
wild excitement Ronald cried, “There she is, there
she is, Lesley! We were only just in time!”</p>

<p>The <i>Vigilant</i> at last hove in sight, steamed to
within a few hundred feet of the shore and then blew
a blast that startled the birds into louder screaming
and greater flapping of wings.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah for the <i>Vigilant</i>!”
cried the children, and in a moment out shot their
father’s flat-bottomed skiff from the rocks, dipping
down behind each breaker and popping up again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
when it had been passed, like a very Jack-in-the-Box.</p>

<p>The “Gov’ment” had never felt it necessary to
build a pier at Friar’s Island, so the only way to land
the stores and the barrels of oil was to lower a few of
them at a time from the tender into the little boat,
row them back to the shore, and then haul them up by
a derrick to a small platform that jutted out from the
rocks. It was Pacific Ocean, you know, straight up to
the island, with no friendly bay or shallow water, just
wild surf and big breakers to the very base of the unfriendly
cliffs.</p>

<p>The children watched the rocking skiff as the first
load was lowered from the ship’s side, McLean receiving
and placing the boxes while Stumpy balanced the
boat with his oars. With eager eyes they watched the
return, and Ronald waded far out to catch the package
of papers and letters which his father threw into
his arms. Then there was a scramble up the rocks and
up the steps to Mother, who scurried off at once to the
house, her skirts flapping in the wind, to look over her
treasures.</p>

<p>The children ran back again to the shore, Ronald
pitching headlong down most of the last flight of
steps, but picking himself up quickly and calling back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to his sister, “No matter, Les’! Nothing but the
nose-bleed!”</p>

<p>His handkerchief held to his nose, he stood by
Lesley on the rocks and watched the slow unloading
of the barrels of oil, which formed, of course, the largest
part of the cargo. Then the <i>Vigilant</i> came to life
again, immediately found herself in great haste, puff-puff-puffed
impatiently, as if saying, “Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!” gave a loud blast of farewell and made off for
her next Lighthouse.</p>

<p>The rolling in to the storehouse and the packing
away of the barrels of oil was not of much interest to
the children, so, as their father had told them that
they need not go home until he went up for dinner
with Jenny Lind and the car, they sought for fresh
amusement.</p>

<p>“I believe I left a book somewhere down here on
the rocks,” said Lesley. “Let’s get it out and read till
Father’s ready.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” shouted Ronald, “I don’t want to read
now. Let’s go up higher and maybe I can fish off the
platform.”</p>

<p>“You remind me of that boy in the ‘po’try’ Mother
reads us,” grumbled Lesley, following him slowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
“the one that went through the Alpine Village holding
the banner.”</p>

<p>“Don’t remember him!” said Ronald, stopping
halfway up the steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s in the Fifth Reader.”</p>

<p>“Well, say him, then!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The shades of night were falling fast</div>
<div class="verse">When through an Alpine Village passed</div>
<div class="verse">A youth, who bore ’mid snow and ice</div>
<div class="verse">A banner with the strange device,</div>
<div class="indent5">Excelsior!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>repeated Lesley, obediently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember. Excelsior! Excelsior!”—and
up the remaining steps the boy scampered like a
squirrel.</p>

<p>Arrived at the platform above, Lesley settled herself
with her book on a coil of rope and began to read
the story of “Perlino,” that enchanting youth made
of wax and sugar and rosewater and roseleaves and
pearls and rubies and sapphires and yellow sewing-silk
by the Princess who was so unsatisfied with the
ordinary ready-made lover. Ronald found his rod
and line, baited his hook from a supply that Stumpy
always had on hand, and, sitting down on the edge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the platform, began to fish for the pink rock cod found
in abundance around the island. He had been trusted
to do this for a year, now, so long as some one was
with him to see that he did not attempt any too daring
feats, and Lesley felt no particular uneasiness as
she glanced up from her story, only called, “Be careful,
Ronnie, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“’Fraid Cat! ’Fraid Cat!” shouted Ronald, scornfully,
turning his head toward her, but in a moment
came a long shrill scream, “Lesley! Lesley! I’m falling!”—and
springing to her feet the frightened girl
saw her brother slip over the edge of the platform
borne down by the weight of his rod. An unusually
large fish must have caught suddenly at the bait,
given it a tug when Ronald was not watching, and
overbalanced the little fisherman.</p>

<p>Beneath the platform was a sheer wall of black rock,
and below that, five or six feet of water into which
Ronald, screaming for help, was plunged. Lesley realized,
even in that moment of terrible fear, that her
father and Stumpy were near at hand and, screaming
for help, too, she rushed to Ronald’s assistance with a
long fish-gaff that stood near by.</p>

<p>Leaning over the platform she caught it in his clothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and held him up for a moment, calling, above the
noise of the breakers, “All right, Ronnie, Father’s
coming, Father’s coming!”</p>

<p>It was only for a moment, however, for the weight
of the struggling and gasping boy was more than
she could hold, and before she knew it she, too, was
dragged over the edge of the platform and down into
the depths below.</p>

<p>The last despairing screams of both children were
heard by the men at the storehouse, and McLean, followed
by Stumpy, ran like a deer toward the sounds,
pulling off his coat as he went. He scrambled up a
rock near the platform and seeing, as he expected, the
struggling forms in the depths below, leaped to their
rescue. He was only just in time, for, as he caught
them and pulled them to the shore, they hung from his
grasp like mere bundles of clothing, limp and lifeless.</p>

<p>Stumpy had waded deep into the water to meet the
stricken father and carried Ronnie to the land. Together
the two men worked over the little bodies,
chafing their hands and working their arms up and
down to expel the water from their lungs, and before
long quivering eyelids and struggles for breath showed
the watchers that the two dear lives were saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Dripping with water like a merman, McLean
rushed for Jenny Lind and the car with Lesley in his
arms, followed by Stumpy with the boy. There was a
tarpaulin on the car which was to have been used to
cover the groceries as they were hauled up to the
Lighthouse, and, throwing this over the children,
Stumpy held them close while McLean urged the unwilling
Jenny Lind over the railway.</p>

<p>Mrs. McLean, whose eyes were never far from the
windows when her bairns were abroad, suddenly
caught a glimpse of Jenny galloping, saw the two men
on the car, and the covered heap beside them. What a
lifetime of agony she went through until she reached
the door and saw that under the canvas cover the
children were breathing, she never could tell you!
They were gathered in their parents’ arms, carried
upstairs, undressed, dried, rubbed, wrapped in warm
flannels, and laid side by side in bed before they could
do more than sob and cry out, “Mother, Mother,
Mother,” over and over again. Ronald did murmur
in a low voice, “Not Lesley’s fault, Mummy; Ronnie’s
fault,” but even those few words were only half-spoken,
as he dropped off to sleep, worn-out with
terror and excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Quivering in every limb with the sudden shock and
the fright that had followed it, Mrs. McLean watched
her darlings as they slept, while the father, who had
told her as much of the accident as he knew himself,
sat below, waiting for the waking. It is true that the
Lightkeeper had been told nothing as yet of what had
happened; but he had found the fish-gaff still caught
in Ronald’s clothing and guessed how it had come
there.</p>

<p>As Margaret McLean sat quietly beside the bed,
Lesley opened her eyes. “Where’s Ronnie?” she
asked, with a startled look.</p>

<p>“Here, Lesley, mother’s faithful little Lesley!”
cried Margaret, bending over her. “It was you who
saved Ronnie and here he is beside you!”</p>

<p>“My Ronnie!” crooned Lesley, lovingly, turning
her heavy head toward the round cheek on the pillow,
“My Ronnie!”—and so, relieved and comforted,
sank softly to sleep again.</p>

<p>It was twilight when Mrs. McLean crept down the
stair to find her husband and Stumpy anxiously
awaiting her. The old sailor had made two trips to
the shore during the afternoon to see that no thievish
rabbit, goat, or sea-bird had made off with the stores,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
but he could find no rest until he had heard the
last news of the day from the “little children of his
heart,” as he called them in his caressing Spanish
way.</p>

<p>“They’ll do now, Father,” said Margaret, thankfully,
leaning wearily against her husband’s arm.
“They’re awake and calling for supper and they’ve
told me all about it. Ronnie only did what he has
always done since we let him use a rod and line, but he
says he never felt such a tug as that fish gave him,
‘since he lived in this country.’”</p>

<p>Here she half-laughed and choked, and so did both
her hearers.</p>

<p>Just then a little head appeared at the window
above, “Mummy, Daddy, sing ‘Eternal Father,’
won’t you, and you too, Stumpy? It’s most evening
now. Les’ and I will sing up here—”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Eternal Father! strong to save,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Who bidst the mighty ocean deep</div>
<div class="verse">Its own appointed limits keep:</div>
<div class="verse">O hear us when we cry to Thee</div>
<div class="verse">For those in peril on the sea!</div>
<div class="verseright">Amen.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The words floated into the air from the open doorway
and, perhaps, for the wind was quiet now, the
song reached some lonely fishing-boat cruising about
the island. The shadows lengthened, and soon the
brave Light sent out its cheering rays across the
waters, while below, saved from the perils of the sea,
the children slept in peace.</p>
